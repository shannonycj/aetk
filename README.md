# AETK
An auto-encoder toolkit, also contains my study notes about various forms of AEs.

The very first notebook, PCA_AE is the begining of my exploration, trying to show that AE wihtout activation function is able to approximate PCA. And then, we show that AE with activations implies a much more complex space that is able to learn more powerful representations than PCA.
